# hashingscript
A simple hashing script for files.

This script will open a dialog box so that the user can select a file. 
After selecting a specific file, the script will generate a MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 hash for that file. 
The script will display the filename/folder location as well as the three generated hashes.
